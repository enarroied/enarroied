üëã Great to have you here! I'm Eric, a **Full Stack Analyst** and Author of the book Getting Started with Taipy.

[![promo banner for Getting Started with Taipy](getting_started_with_taipy_promo.jpg)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1836203810)

As a full-stack analyst, I bring can take care of every stage of the data cycle with both technical rigor and focus on stakeholders and business needs. I design and deploy scalable pipelines through batch processing or real-time data ingestion. I also build intuitive and interactive data applications using frameworks such as Taipy.

Beyond engineering and visualization, I emphasize best practices in version control and CI/CD to ensure that workflows are collaborative, maintainable, and production-ready. I also place strong focus on documentation and technical writing, making complex processes and methodologies accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## A Few Things About Me

üç∑ I spent 8 years working in the wine industry, where my journey into tech began. **While learning QGIS to manage vineyards, I discovered Python and quickly started developing practical solutions to automate my work**. That experience sparked my passion for programming, and to this day I remain deeply interested in GIS.

üéì I hold a MSc in Viticulture and Wine-Making, and a BS in biology. While working in the wine industry, I completed a first year of computer science, followed by numerous online courses on programming, data analysis, data science and data warehousing through platforms like Coursera, EdX, and France Universit√© Num√©rique. You can find more details on [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericnarro/).

üíº With over 3 years of experience in the data warehousing division of a large insurance corporation, I have also worked with small businesses and agricultural non-profits, where I focused on building lean but highly practical solutions. Alongside this, I‚Äôve cultivated an independent practice as a technical writer and content creator. This mix of large-scale corporate exposure, hands-on problem solving in resource-constrained environments, and communication-focused work has made me highly versatile, and ultimately shaped me into a full-stack analyst who can adapt to different contexts and deliver end-to-end solutions.

üñäÔ∏è You can check **some of my writing [on Medium](https://medium.com/@ericnarro)**. I write about data analysis, Python, Data Ops, career shifting, and upcoming technologies like AI and LLMs.

üé• You can also check my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ericnarro), I wish to create more content there, so feel free to take a look at it (and **like, and subscribe!**)

üíª I'm a **contributor to [Taipy](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy)**, an **open-source** Python application builder. I wrote a book it and contributed with numerous 20+ issues.

‚õ∞Ô∏è I'm a **remote worker**, and **I live in rural France**. I've always wanted to live in rural areas, that is why studied wine-making in the first place. I believe remote work is one part of the solution to bring life back to rural Europe. Obviously, the solution is complex and will require **lots of human action**, remote workers can't be THE solution, just another brick in the wall. If this is something that resonates with you, feel free to connect with me!

üì∏ Besides technology, [I love photography](https://www.deviantart.com/ericnarro) and exploring new places, especially rural areas (but I also like exploring cities, as long as I don't spend too much time in them!)

* I've used Hugging Face's transformers library for fine-tuning LLMs on specific tasks.
* I've built RAG pipelines using vector databases such as Qdrant, Chroma, or using pgvector.
