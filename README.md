üëã Great to have you here! I'm Eric, a Data Analyst at Sophia Engineering.

üç∑ I have a background of 8 years in the wine industry. During this time, I discovered Python programming because I was learning QGIS to help me manage vineyards.

üéì I've Completed a first year of computer science while working, followed by numerous online courses on programming, data analysis, and data science through platforms like Coursera, EdX, and France Universit√© Num√©rique.

üåç One of my first personal projects was to create a plugin for QGIS ([Point Cadastre](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/point_cadastre/)).

üìà My journey into data analysis began with a simple interest in handling data, thanks to Excel pivot tables. I enjoy sifting through data, creating meaningful charts, and understanding the story it tells.

üñäÔ∏è Apart from my work, I also [write on Medium](https://medium.com/@ericnarro) about data analysis, career shifts, and upcoming technologies like AI and LLMs. 

üíª I'm a contributor to [Taipy](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy), an open-source Python application builder.

üì∏ Besides technology, [I love photography](https://www.deviantart.com/ericnarro) and exploring new places. I believe that creativity and curiosity are essential qualities for any data analyst, and I try to bring these qualities to both my work and my hobbies.
